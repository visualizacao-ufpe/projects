Initial types of visualization:

1. Audio features within an artist
    - parallel coordinates
    - histograms
    * Finish brush selection
    * We need to come up with a way to view which line corresponds to which song in the visualization

2. Artist's "progression" i.e. "change" of style between albums
    - ???
    * How to calculate the change from one album to another? Average? Difference?

Albuns : 
The Beatles (v)
Michael Jackson (? - maintain posthumous albuns?)
Pink Floyd (v)
Metallica (v)
Radiohead (v)
Madonna (v)
2Pac (Tupac Shakur) (v)

*Gathering:
Nirvana (4/4)
Eminem (7/8)
Led Zeppelin (9/9)
The Clash (5/6)
Talking Heads (8/8)


3. Artist X Artist
    - Force-grid graph
    * How to compare artists? How to calculate the difference between artists?
    
What we need from audio features:
danceability
energy
key
loudness
mode
speechiness
acousticness
instrumentalness
liveness
valence
tempo
duration_ms
time_signature
    
Qualitative:
Key
Time Signature
Mode

Quantitative that are not so interesting:
duration_ms
Liveness 
Speechiness 
Instrumentalness
Acousticness 
Tempo
Loudness

Quantitative more interesting :
Energy
Danceability
Valence

FINAL TWEAKS:
> Integrate boxplot/scatterplot view into coordinated view
> Add some indication that an artist has albums to show
> Join jsons
